RoadSignsDetection
==================

Road Signs Detection System

Road signs recognition based on Hopfield discreet neural network. 

###Todo
1. Milestone 1
	* Network research
		- Internal net structure
		- Working principles
		- Training models
	* Choose enviroment
	* Prepare sets of traffic signs in common format
	* Simple pre-processing of images
	

2. Milestone 2
 	* Scaling down and tresholding images
 	* Implementation of Hopfield network
 		- Hebbian learning method
 		- Inverse propagation method
 	* Training Hopfield network with few samples
