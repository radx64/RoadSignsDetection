RoadSignsDetection
==================

Road Signs Detection System

Road signs recognition based on Hopfield discreet neural network. 

###Todo
1. Milestone I
	* Network research
		- Internal net structure
		- Working principles
		- Training models
	* Choose enviroment
	* Prepare sets of traffic signs in common format
	* Simple pre-processing of images
	

2. Milestone II
 	* Scaling down and tresholding images
 	* Implementation of Hopfield network
 		- Hebbian learning method
 	* Training Hopfield network with few samples
 	
3. Milestone III
	* Implementation of new training models for Hopfield network
		- Pseudoinversion method
		- Delta method
