RoadSignsDetection
==================

Road Signs Detection System

Road signs recognition based on Hopfield discreet neural network. 

###Todo
1. Milestone I
	* [x] Network research
		- [x] Internal net structure
		- [x] Working principles
		- [x] Training models
	* [x] Choose enviroment
	* [x] Prepare sets of traffic signs in common format
	* [x] Simple pre-processing of images
	

2. Milestone II
 	* [x] Scaling down and tresholding images
 	* [x] Implementation of Hopfield network
 		- [x] Hebbian learning method
 	* [x] Training Hopfield network with few samples
 	
3. Milestone III
	* [x] Implementation of new training models for Hopfield network
		- [x] Pseudoinversion method
		- [x] Delta method
 
4. Milestone IV
 	* [] Teach network of every choosen road sign
 	* [] Write some noise generator for pattern recovery
	* [] Make some test on network using all teaching methods
